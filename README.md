# BehringerX32MuteFollower
This application allows a Slave Behringer X32 digital mixer to follow the channel mutes on a Master mixer. This is useful in an audio environment where a seperate Foldback or IEM mixer is used and controlled remotely from FOH, channels can be muted / unmuted simultaneously on both mixers.
